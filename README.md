-   [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - The core open source library to help you develop and train ML models. Get started quickly by running Colab notebooks directly in your browser.

And of course this project itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/nikhil96widhani/Authorship-Classification-using-NLTK) on GitHub.

**Installation and How to run**

-   It is recommended to use Anaconda as the python environment running python 3
-   [Download and install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
-   Download and install Anaconda from this [link](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
-   Use Spyder IDE from Anaconda Navigator in order to run the code.
-   Alternative Use PyCharm IDE for running this code

**System requirements**

[anaconda website](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

-   Operating system: Windows 7 or newer, 64-bit macOS 10.10+, or Linux, including Ubuntu, RedHat, CentOS 6+, and others.
-   If your operating system is older than what is currently supported, you can find older versions of the Anaconda installers in our archive that might work for you. Check our FAQ for version recommendations.
-   System architecture: Windows- 64-bit x86, 32-bit x86; MacOS- 64-bit x86; Linux- 64-bit x86, 32-bit x86, 64-bit Power8/Power9.
-   Minimum 5 GB disk space to download and install.

On Windows, macOS, and Linux, it is best to install Anaconda for the local user, which does not require administrator permissions and is the most robust type of installation. However, if you need to, you can install Anaconda system wide, which does require administrator permissions.
